Abstract  :

There is enough evidence to prove that overall physical, psychological and communal welfare of a human being is predominantly dependent on their mental health.  Depression is a common illness worldwide, with more than 264 million people affected. Close to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year. Suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29-year-olds. Thus, early recognition and mediation in addressing issues regarding it is of utmost importance.  Individualized and ubiquitous sensing technologies such as smartphones, smartwatches etc. allow continuous tracking and gathering of data in an undisturbed and low-profile manner. Sentimental Analysis using Natural Language Processing has been proposed to be applied to the collected data to monitor. This project aims at gathering the data from the user through a chatbot which will be analysed by the system to prepare and publish the report to the user to keep them aware of their mental health.



OBJECTIVE :

We propose to design a novel health monitoring system using Telegram chatbot which interacts with the user and makes observations on their conversation patterns. The system essentially tries to understand the emotional and mental state of the user based on the words they use to converse with the bot. The system then keeps a track of the changes of emotional and mental state of the person to make a monthly report on the mental health of the user. This system can be very crucial in keeping a track of the user to let them know how they are doing mentally. 




CONCLUSION:

The project, Mental health report using chatbot was designed and realized using RStudio. The System is implemented on various test text files which are received through a telegram to RStudio and the results are inferred. The software of this project system is simple and can be implemented with ease. The Sentimental analysis done using the Syuzhet package with its all methods like bing, affin, etc. functions properly in all the scenarios as pre-programmed. Since the outputs are pictorial representations of sentiment produced by the system using the syuzhet package which has an accuracy of 70-80 % so, one can consider it successfully functioning and can be used for non-professional use.
